    <h1>Final Note</h1>
    <p>We have previously explored how music shapes us. While genres might categorize us, emotions are universal and music taste is subjective. Next time you judge a song or a person by what he listen to, try to understand why this style is liked by people. You might be surprised with what you find, or not, and that's ok because you tried.</p>
